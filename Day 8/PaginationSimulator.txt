Step 1 — Decide Pagination Logic
You need these variables:
-> currentPage
-> itemsPerPage
-> totalItems
-> totalPages = Math.ceil(totalItems / itemsPerPage)


Step 2 — Slice Data for Current Page
Core logic:
-> startIndex = (currentPage - 1) * itemsPerPage
-> endIndex = startIndex + itemsPerPage
-> visibleItems = data.slice(startIndex, endIndex)

This is the heart of pagination.
If you don’t understand this part, everything else is decoration.


Step 3 — Render Items
Display:
-> Title
-> Description
-> ID


Step 4 — Pagination Controls
Add:
-> Next button
-> Previous button
-> Page numbers


Step 5 — Disable Buttons Properly
Most beginners forget this and it looks amateur.
Rules:
-> Disable Prev on page 1
-> Disable Next on last page


Step 6 — Show Page Info
Make UI informative:
-> Showing 21–30 of 100 results

That small detail makes the project look more real.
