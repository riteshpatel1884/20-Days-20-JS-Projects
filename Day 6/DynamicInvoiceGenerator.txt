Step 1 — Design the UI (HTML)
You need two main sections:
A. Input Section
-> Item name
-> Quantity
-> Price
-> Add button

B. Invoice Section
-> Table showing items
-> Subtotal
-> Total


Step 2 — Data Structure (important)
-> Each item should be stored as an object:
{
  name: "Pen",
  quantity: 2,
  price: 10,
  total: 20
}
-> Store all items in an array: let items = [];


Step 3 — Render Invoice Table
Create a function: renderInvoice(items)
Inside it:
-> Clear table body
-> Loop through items
-> Create rows dynamically

Important rule:
Always render from the array, not manually append rows randomly.


Step 5 — Calculate Totals
-> Subtotal logic: sum of item totals
-> You can calculate using: reduce()
-> Then display: Subtotal and Grand Total


Improved version:
Don't repeat the item if it is duplicated instead of it only increase its qty.
