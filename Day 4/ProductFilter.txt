Step 1 — Prepare Product Data
-> Create an array of objects:


Step 2 — Create UI Layout (HTML)
You need:
-> Filter buttons or dropdown
-> Container to display products


Step 3 — Render Products
Write a function that:
-> Clears the container
-> Loops through products
-> Creates product cards
-> Appends them

Important habit:
Always render from the array, not manually add HTML pieces randomly.


Step 4 — Add Filter Logic
When a filter button is clicked:
-> Filter products array using: filteredProducts = products.filter(...)
-> Call render function using filtered array.
